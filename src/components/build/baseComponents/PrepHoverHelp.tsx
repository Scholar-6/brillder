  This is a timed section, and though learners will not be moved on to the next section automatically, we recommend that you try to be fair with your estimation of how long this section will take. This will help learners apportion 20, 40, or 60 minutes to a brick and have the satisfaction of completing them within that timeframe. Within these lengths, it should be possible to allocate 5, 10, or 15 minutes respectively to complete the prep section.
