Please read the following terms and conditions before you use our service or buy any &#39;Digital Content&#39; from us.  We hope they contain everything you&#39;d expect, and nothing unreasonable.

This user agreement includes:

What is a Brick?

A Brick is our unit of digital learning  content that is published at URL(s) and via our applications and services.  The Brick is partially public and details such as your username and/or your full name may be displayed for the general public to view if your brick is published.

The default status of a new Brick is &#39;private&#39;.  This means you are able to share a link to your Bricks with other users (e.g. learners), at your own discretion, but it will not appear in our public catalogue.  In order to keep our platform safe from inappropriate activity, we do monitor private content and activity for policy breaches.

- to delete Bricks in their entirety which breach our Acceptable Use Policy;

Authors of Bricks published to our Public Catalogue may quote from, embed, access and link to intellectual property which is not owned by us providing that such intellectual property is quoted, embedded, accessed or linked to on terms acceptable to its owners, where ownership applies. In cases where images are embedded, this means images must either be freely available for commercial re-use under Creative Commons licences, or created by the author (e.g. as a graph or tabular illustration) and automatically ceded to our ownership as a precondition of the publication process.

1. Authors of Bricks retained within a Private Catalogue may quote from, embed, access and link to intellectual property which is not owned by us providing that they do so within the the terms of the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988 (as amended) which allows instances where intellectual property may be shared for non-commercial educational purposes. In the context of a brick created for private, non-commercial, educational circulation we require the Content Author to interpret the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988.

1. A Content Author may not circulate a brick from his or her Private Catalogue for commercial purposes or beyond a reasonably defined and circumscribed class, group or learning cohort.

1. The author of a Brick which originates within a Private Catalogue may seek to have it published to the Public Catalogue provided that the higher standards and threshold for intellectual property rights are respected and provided that ownership of original content is ceded to us.

**Hyperlinks, Embeds and third party sites**

1. The Site may contain hyperlinks, embedded content or references to third party websites other than the Site.  Any such hyperlinks, embedded content or references are provided for your convenience only.  We have no control over third party websites and accept no legal responsibility for any content, material or information contained in them; this includes any advertising which may from time to time appear in embedded content within the Site. The display of any hyperlink, embedded content and reference to any third party website does not mean that we endorse that third party&#39;s website, products or services. Your use of a third party site may be governed by the terms and conditions of that third party site.

**Assignment**

1. You may not assign the agreement or any rights under the agreement to any third party.

4. Content Creators

1. If you upload content or create any Digital Content on the Site, including using the Site to adapt existing content; you agree to be legally bound by this part of the agreement which applies to you (in addition to the previous parts of this contract).

3. Private Bricks are for non-commercial, educational use with a single individual, classroom, learning group (e.g. tutorial group or seminar), or learning cohort (e.g. a year group within a school).

5. Creators of Public Bricks will be issued a separate contract (as an addendum to this contract) during the submission to the public catalogue.
6. We reserve the right to grant payment and/or privileges (e.g. discounts) to content creators whose Brick(s) are successfully published into the Public Catalogue to be accessed by other Teachers and Learners.
7. By creating a Brick, whether for a Private Catalogue or Submission to the Public Catalogue, you grant to us a royalty-free, irrevocable, non-exclusive, transferable licence to use, reproduce, modify, publish, edit, translate, distribute, perform and display the Brick (in whole or in part) on the Site, and on any other websites operated by us, indefinitely. However:

  - we undertake not to  publicly circulate a Private Catalogue Brick (i.e. adopt it into the Public Catalogue) without the author&#39;s permission; and
  - we undertake not to edit or modify a brick created for personal use without seeking and obtaining the consent of the creator.
- An author whose Brick is published to the Public Catalogue is entitled to a share of downstream revenue by any commercial users of that brick, as is any editor/publisher who assists in shaping, finalising or revising a Public Catalogue brick. The terms by which downstream revenue is apportioned to authors will be published transparently and may be revised from time to time by us. While all content made available on the Public Catalogue becomes the property of Scholar 6 Ltd. , the downstream revenue mechanism is designed to ensure that authors are incentivised to create high-quality, enduring bricks. Likewise, authors automatically concede that in order to update, improve and revise Bricks we may from time to time and without notice make changes to a Brick.
- A Brick may not be withdrawn from the Public Catalogue by an author, though an author may request that their name be cancelled as author, in which case an alternative name (e.g. of the most recent editor) may be inserted. An author who withholds or cancels/withdraws his or her name will forfeit any entitlement to downstream revenue which arises after the name is withheld or withdrawn.
- We reserve the right to remove any Brick from the Public Catalogue, or replace it with an alternative Brick.
- While we try to make sure that the Site is secure, we cannot guarantee the confidentiality of any information that you supply to us. For that reason, we advise you not to include any patentable ideas or patent applications, advertising or marketing suggestions, prototypes, or any other information that you regard as confidential, commercially sensitive or valuable within a Brick, even one intended for personal use and the Private Catalogue. We define any such submissions as  Unwanted Submissions. You agree not to hold us accountable for the misuse or appropriation by another party such Unwanted Submissions.
- We will not be legally responsible for keeping any Unwanted Submissions confidential nor will we be legally responsible to you or anybody else for any use of such Unwanted Submissions.

# C BRILLS & COMPETITIONS

1 **Brills in Normal Play**. All users collect brills when they play bricks. These are reward points 
  	but have no financial value or equivalence to currency. Their cash value is set and redeemed 
  	according to the context and judgement of Brillder’s operators, and no redemption is possible    
    without the exchange of information and permissions by the player/claimant (see 8 below). In 
  	normal play they correspond with percentage  scores achieved of 50% or above. (A score of 
    79% earns 79 brills; 49% zero brills.) Normal play is distinct from competition play.

2 **Brills in Normal Play**. 100% bonus in Normal Play. If a user scores 100%, they get 200 brills, reflecting a high score bonus.

3 **Replaying and Brills**. All users can earn extra brills if they play a brick again. Thus a score of 
    65% at a first attempt would receive 65 brills, which, if followed by a score of 73% in a second attempt, would earn 8 additional brills (not 73 additional brills). A second attempt which achieved a lower score would not have brills deducted.

4 **Brills in Competition Play**. Brillder sets competitions in four academic fields every week     
  	(unless a technical or production problem prevents this) which can be found on the Prizes Page: 
  	General & Topical, Humanities (e.g. History & Literature), Maths and Science (normally, one of 
   	Biology, Chemistry and Physics). It ‘costs’ two credits per brick rather than one to enter a   
 	  competition, but all brill scores above 50% are doubled for all players, so a score of 81% earns 
  	162 brills. However, the main benefit of competitions is the prize pots which can be adjusted 
  	from week to week but may be worth thousands of brills for each brick. Usually the top three 
  	placed players share the prize pot with 70% of the pot reserved for an outright winner. If there 
  	are more than three players who cannot be separated (e.g. twelve on the same top score), the 
   	pot is divided between those on level scores. If large numbers of players are competing, Brillder 
  	may also award a smaller proportion of brills based on finishing in the top quartile / 20% etc.

5 **Brills for Institution** (e.g. Sixth Form College)  and **Library Users** (e.g. within free local Public 
  	Library digital resources) may earn brills but these cannot be exchanged for cash or any other 
  	prize, although an Institution or Library User 

6 **Complaints and Decisions**. Anyone can make a mistake and we are always receptive to an 
  	inquiry from a player who believes their scores are wrong. We are committed to conducting all 
  	aspects of both education and competition ethically. However, Brillder is also a new start-up and 
  	sometimes we have to take tough or unpopular decisions. We reserve the right to ‘move the 
  	Goalposts’ should competition circumstances become unmanageable. We do not accept that 
  	playing a brick is, in and of itself, onerous and unedifying, or the argument that a player would 
   	only play on the expectation of a cash reward.  Brills are intended to incentivise 
 	  learning and enhance the sense of reward from study.

7 **Brills Valuation**. ‘Premium’, paying subscribing players can currently trade in brills for cash 
 	prizes. We only award cash prizes to subscribers and cannot award prizes to players who earn 
  	brills for free (e.g. via an Institution or Library account), nor can we transfer ‘historical’ brills  
  	from an institution or Library user’s account to a new premium account.  On occasion - such as a 
  	promotional competition - we may give players an option to ‘purchase’ a premium subscription 
  	with brills earned when playing for free, but only in the case of introductory or trial accounts. If 
     	brills are earned by legitimate paying subscribers, we reserve the right to set or change the 
  	‘exchange rate’ - for example, reducing value  in cases where an individual has won a large 
 	number of brills from a competition in which there were few or no other competitors.

8 **Promotional Context of Prize Claims**. The ability to exchange brills for real cash prizes requires 
  	Brillder to be able to obtain  information from winners, as well as  the permission to post such 
  	information. This information may include full name, school, college or institution where the 
 	  winner studies (if in full time study), the winner’s academic year group and age, and a selfie 
   	taken with the Brillder cash prize certificate on a screen behind the winner, as well as a sentence 
  	or two on what you think of Brillder, bricks and the competitions. All of these factors enable us 
  	to prove to prospective players that existing winners are real.

9 **Bank Account and Age of Claimants**. Claimants must be sixteen or older (if under sixteen, they 
 	can keep saving brills until they are sixteen). Anyone sixteen or over can open a bank account for 
  	free without parental permission. The name on the bank account must correspond with your 
  	given name.

10 **The Brillderverse**. Brillder’s style, content, catalogue, competitions, terminology, format and 
   	rules are the intellectual property of the company and we reserve the right to alter any 
element of our product and system.
