Please read the following terms and conditions before you use our service or buy any &#39;Digital Content&#39; from us.  We hope they contain everything you&#39;d expect, and nothing unreasonable.

This user agreement includes:

What is a Brick?

A Brick is our unit of digital learning  content that is published at URL(s) and via our applications and services.  The Brick is partially public and details such as your username and/or your full name may be displayed for the general public to view if your brick is published.

The default status of a new Brick is &#39;private&#39;.  This means you are able to share a link to your Bricks with other users (e.g. students), at your own discretion, but it will not appear in our public catalogue.  In order to keep our platform safe from inappropriate activity, we do monitor private content and activity for policy breaches.

Content created by an author and/or teacher which is not published to the Public Catalogue remains within a Private Catalogue accessed and distributed by the author for learning and teaching purposes within a reasonably defined and circumscribed class, group or learning cohort for which the author has educational responsibility and for whose benefit the author may share (i.e. quote, embed, access or link to)  content consistent with the terms of the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988 (as amended).

- to delete Bricks in their entirety which breach our Acceptable Use Policy;

Authors of Bricks published to our Public Catalogue may quote from, embed, access and link to intellectual property which is not owned by us providing that such intellectual property is quoted, embedded, accessed or linked to on terms acceptable to its owners, where ownership applies. In cases where images are embedded, this means images must either be freely available for commercial re-use under Creative Commons licences, or created by the author (e.g. as a graph or tabular illustration) and automatically ceded to our ownership as a precondition of the publication process.

1. Authors of Bricks retained within a Private Catalogue may quote from, embed, access and link to intellectual property which is not owned by us providing that they do so within the the terms of the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988 (as amended) which allows instances where intellectual property may be shared for non-commercial educational purposes. In the context of a brick created for private, non-commercial, educational circulation we require the Content Author to interpret the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988.

1. A Content Author may not circulate a brick from his or her Private Catalogue for commercial purposes or beyond a reasonably defined and circumscribed class, group or learning cohort.

1. The author of a Brick which originates within a Private Catalogue may seek to have it published to the Public Catalogue provided that the higher standards and threshold for intellectual property rights are respected and provided that ownership of original content is ceded to us.

**Hyperlinks, Embeds and third party sites**

1. The Site may contain hyperlinks, embedded content or references to third party websites other than the Site.  Any such hyperlinks, embedded content or references are provided for your convenience only.  We have no control over third party websites and accept no legal responsibility for any content, material or information contained in them; this includes any advertising which may from time to time appear in embedded content within the Site. The display of any hyperlink, embedded content and reference to any third party website does not mean that we endorse that third party&#39;s website, products or services. Your use of a third party site may be governed by the terms and conditions of that third party site.

**Assignment**

1. You may not assign the agreement or any rights under the agreement to any third party.

1. No one other than a party to this contract has any right to enforce any term of this contract.

4. Content Creators

1. If you upload content or create any Digital Content on the Site, including using the Site to adapt existing content; you agree to be legally bound by this part of the agreement which applies to you (in addition to the previous parts of this contract).
2. As a condition of your use of the Site in order to create or adapt Digital Content, you agree to comply with our user policies (including the **Acceptable Use Policy** ).
3. Private Bricks are for non-commercial, educational use with a single individual, classroom, learning group (e.g. tutorial group or seminar), or learning cohort (e.g. a year group within a school).
4. Public Bricks are bricks submitted by the creator and/or selected by us for inclusion in the public catalogue. They will form part of our commercial offering.
5. Creators of Public Bricks will be issued a separate contract (as an addendum to this contract) during the submission to the public catalogue.
6. We reserve the right to grant payment and/or privileges (e.g. discounts) to content creators whose Brick(s) are successfully published into the Public Catalogue to be accessed by other Teachers and Students.
7. By creating a Brick, whether for a Private Catalogue or Submission to the Public Catalogue, you grant to us a royalty-free, irrevocable, non-exclusive, transferable licence to use, reproduce, modify, publish, edit, translate, distribute, perform and display the Brick (in whole or in part) on the Site, and on any other websites operated by us, indefinitely. However:

  - we undertake not to  publicly circulate a Private Catalogue Brick (i.e. adopt it into the Public Catalogue) without the author&#39;s permission; and
  - we undertake not to edit or modify a brick created for personal use without seeking and obtaining the consent of the creator.
- An author whose Brick is published to the Public Catalogue is entitled to a share of downstream revenue by any commercial users of that brick, as is any editor/publisher who assists in shaping, finalising or revising a Public Catalogue brick. The terms by which downstream revenue is apportioned to authors will be published transparently and may be revised from time to time by us. While all content made available on the Public Catalogue becomes the property of Scholar 6 Ltd. , the downstream revenue mechanism is designed to ensure that authors are incentivised to create high-quality, enduring bricks. Likewise, authors automatically concede that in order to update, improve and revise Bricks we may from time to time and without notice make changes to a Brick.
- A Brick may not be withdrawn from the Public Catalogue by an author, though an author may request that their name be cancelled as author, in which case an alternative name (e.g. of the most recent editor) may be inserted. An author who withholds or cancels/withdraws his or her name will forfeit any entitlement to downstream revenue which arises after the name is withheld or withdrawn.
- We reserve the right to remove any Brick from the Public Catalogue, or replace it with an alternative Brick.
- While we try to make sure that the Site is secure, we cannot guarantee the confidentiality of any information that you supply to us. For that reason, we advise you not to include any patentable ideas or patent applications, advertising or marketing suggestions, prototypes, or any other information that you regard as confidential, commercially sensitive or valuable within a Brick, even one intended for personal use and the Private Catalogue. We define any such submissions as  Unwanted Submissions. You agree not to hold us accountable for the misuse or appropriation by another party such Unwanted Submissions.
- We will not be legally responsible for keeping any Unwanted Submissions confidential nor will we be legally responsible to you or anybody else for any use of such Unwanted Submissions.
