<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>


Your privacy is important to us. It is Scholar 6’s policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect from you when using Brillder<sup>TM</sup>. We have tried to keep this as simple and self-explanatory as possible.

<h2>What information do we collect?</h2>


We currently store your email, first name, last name, a Google id (if you have logged in with Google), a username, subjects you have selected as relevant to you, and any additional details you have added to your profile.

In order to optimise development and cross-platform compatibility, we track every request to our API (Application Programming Interface). This means that actions like adding, editing or 

playing a brick will be stored.

For the application to function as (we hope!) you would expect it to (ie. for your actions to be remembered from page-to-page while navigating) we also track your user session using a session cookie. If you delete this cookie then you will need to login again in order to access your account.

There is absolutely no external advertising on our platform, and we do not give your data to any third parties. See our Cookie Policy (below) for more information.

<h2>What is the Legal basis for collecting this information?</h2>


By signing up to Brillder, agreeing to this policy and using the service, you are providing informed consent. It is also in the legitimate interest of Scholar 6 Limited to provide a better service to our users. Both of these reasons form the legal basis for storing and using your information.

<h2>How do we use your information?</h2>


We use this information to provide a better service for our users including sending notifications when other users edit, suggest changes, or play your bricks. From time to time, we may also send marketing communications to your email, from which you may opt out in the app.

We may use aggregate data from many different people with a machine learning algorithm to learn patterns of behaviour which can help us improve your experience of the system.

<h2>What are your rights?</h2>


You have the following rights:



1. The right to be informed
2. The right of access
3. The right to rectification
4. The right to erasure
5. The right to restrict processing
6. The right to data portability
7. The right to object
8. Rights in relation to automated decision making and profiling.

<h2>Who controls this information?</h2>


The controller of this information is Scholar 6 Limited, which is a registered company in England. You can contact us using the ‘Help’ button in the bottom left of each Brillder webpage or by emailing admin@scholar6.org

<h2>Do we share this information?</h2>


Your details will only be shared with other Brillder users on an individual and consensual basis. A student must first accept a teacher’s invitation for the teacher to see their play attempts and learning records for the subject(s) they teach. As above, we do not share lists of user details with any third parties (such as selling your email as part of a list to another company).

<h2>How do you revoke your consent?</h2>


To revoke your consent for us to use your personal information at any time please email admin@scholar6.org. We can delete your account and all private data, however details such as your name which you have elected to publish publicly on your bricks are no longer private and may stay associated with the bricks you created.
